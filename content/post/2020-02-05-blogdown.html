<p>I am an avid R-user. It is my tool of choice when it comes to nearly any project that involves data analysis and visualization. The thing I enjoy most about R is the community. I’ve learned a ton of knowledge from people in the community who constantly share their work and help others. Lately, I’ve been trying to figure out the best way that I can share the things I’ve learned in order to give back to the community, and I stumbled upon the blogdown package.</p>
<p>In this post, I will give a brief walk-through of how I was able to create this website using blogdown and a few other tools, and also share some tips and resources that were beneficial to me during development.</p>
<div id="getting-started" class="section level1">
<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>I highly recommend reading the first few chapters of <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown</a> by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, and Alison Presmanes Hill. Not only does the book teach you how to use the blogdown package in R, but it also provides a good tutorial on <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, which controls the theme of your website, and ways to deploy your website such as through <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github pages</a>, which is what I am using to host my website.</p>
<p>Another resource that I recommend is this <a href="https://amber.rbind.io/2016/12/19/website/">blog post</a> by Amber Thomas. I found the section on initializing github pages to work with Hugo and blogdown to be especially helpful.</p>
</div>
<div id="blogdown-package" class="section level1">
<h1>Blogdown Package</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Install the blogdown package within RStudio:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;blogdown&quot;)
</code></pre>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Use the helper function to install Hugo:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>blogdown::install_hugo()
</code></pre>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a new project in RStudio by clicking <code>File -&gt; New Project</code></li>
</ol>
<p>This will be the directory where all the files for your website are stored. You can easily navigate and view these files within RStudio under the Files tab.</p>

</div>
<div id="hugo-theme" class="section level1">
<h1>Hugo Theme</h1>
<p>Pick a theme for your website from <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. The theme I settled on was the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/">Academic</a> theme because I liked both the look and the functionality, but there are plenty of other options available as well.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Once you have chosen a theme, you can download it using the following blogdown command:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code># Replace user/repo from the theme&#39;s Github repository
blogdown::new_site(theme = &#39;user/repo&#39;)
</code></pre>
<p>The files that control the contents of the theme should be available in your working directory and now you can start editing within RStudio!</p>
<p><i>(Note: I will not go into detail on how to edit the configuration files as these differ for each theme. However, if you’re interested in the edits that I made within the Academic theme, you can view them on my <a href="https://github.com/kcuilla/kcuilla.github.io/tree/master">github</a>).</i></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>To view your edits in real-time, run the command below and you will be able to see a preview of your website in the Viewer tab in RStudio and also have the option to view it in your browser by clicking the ‘Show in new window’ icon:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>blogdown::serve_site()
</code></pre>
<p>You can also embed plots. See Figure <a href="#fig:pie">1</a> for example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c(&#39;Sky&#39;, &#39;Sunny side of pyramid&#39;, &#39;Shady side of pyramid&#39;),
  col = c(&#39;#0292D8&#39;, &#39;#F7EA39&#39;, &#39;#C4B632&#39;),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)</code></pre>

<pre class="r"><code>
data(diamonds, mpg, package = &quot;ggplot2&quot;)

hchart(mpg, &quot;scatter&quot;, hcaes(x = displ, y = hwy, group = class)) %&gt;%
