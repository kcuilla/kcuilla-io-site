<p>Near the end of 2020, RStudio hosted an inaugural table contest. For my entry, I decided to submit the table I created in this <a href="https://kcuilla.netlify.app/post/2019-nfl-team-ratings/">post</a> (with a few minor updates).</p>
<p>Out of 80+ entries to the contest, my table received an honorable mention! <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/12/23/winners-of-the-2020-rstudio-table-contest/">Winners of the 2020 RStudio Table Contest</a></p>
<p>The table I entered can be seen on <a href="https://rpubs.com/kcuilla/nfl_team_ratings">RPubs</a>, and the code to create the table can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/kcuilla/2020-RStudio-Table-Contest">GitHub</a>.</p>
