I am a Senior Quantitative Analyst within the fintech industry. I love solving problems and extracting insights from data through analysis and visualization. 

I received my Master's Degree in Data Analytics from Penn State University. Before that, I attended the University of Maryland where I studied Environmental Science & Technology with a focus in the design of ecotechnology systems.
